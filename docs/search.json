Join me on this wild ride as I navigate the tangled web of single-cell genomics, armed with nothing but code and a few cups of coffee.\nI am a computational biology PhD student in the Bioinformatics and Cellular Genomics Lab at St. Vincent’s Institute of Medical Research and University of Melbourne, in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nMy research focuses on single-cell genomics data analysis and development of computational tools for a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases.\nOutside of work, I love to travel on a budget and catch up on my beauty sleep."
