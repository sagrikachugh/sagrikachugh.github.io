    "text": "Abstract\nCommon genetic variants confer substantial risk for chronic lung diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Defining the genetic control of gene expression in a cell-type-specific and context-dependent manner is critical for understanding the mechanisms through which genetic variation influences complex traits and disease pathobiology. To this end, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of lung tissue from 67 PF and 49 unaffected donors. Employing a pseudo-bulk approach, we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) across 38 cell types, observing both shared and cell type-specific regulatory effects. Further, we identified disease-interaction eQTL and demonstrated that this class of associations is more likely to be cell-type specific and linked to cellular dysregulation in PF. Finally, we connected PF risk variants to their regulatory targets in disease-relevant cell types. These results indicate that cellular context determines the impact of genetic variation on gene expression, and implicates context-specific eQTL as key regulators of lung homeostasis and disease."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntroduction: The microalga Parachlorella kessleri-I produces high biomass and lipid content that could be suitable for producing economically viable biofuel at a commercial scale. Sequencing the complete chloroplast genome is crucial for the construction of a species-specific chloroplast transformation vector.\nMethods: In this study, the complete chloroplast genome sequence (cpDNA) of P. kessleri-I was assembled; annotated and genetic transformation of the chloroplast was optimized. For the chloroplast transformation, we have tested two antibiotic resistance makers, aminoglycoside adenine transferase (aadA) gene and Sh-ble gene conferring resistance to spectinomycin and zeocin, respectively. Transgene integration and homoplasty determination were confirmed using PCR, Southern blot and Droplet Digital PCR.\nResults: The chloroplast genome (109,642 bp) exhibited a quadripartite structure with two reverse repeat regions (IRA and IRB), a long single copy (LSC), and a small single copy (SSC) region. The genome encodes 116 genes, with 80 protein-coding genes, 32 tRNAs and 4 rRNAs. The cpDNA provided essential information like codons, UTRs and flank sequences for homologous recombination to make a species-specific vector that facilitated the transformation of P. kessleri-I chloroplast. The transgenic algal colonies were retrieved on a TAP medium containing 400 mg. L-1 spectinomycin, but no transgenic was recovered on the zeocin-supplemented medium. PCR and Southern blot analysis ascertained the transgene integration into the chloroplast genome, via homologous recombination. The chloroplast genome copy number in wildtype and transgenic P. kessleri-I was determined using Droplet Digital PCR.\nConclusion: The optimization of stable chloroplast transformation in marine alga P. kessleri-I should open a gateway for directly engineering the strain for carbon concentration mechanisms to fix more CO2, improving the photosynthetic efficiency and reducing the overall biofuels production cost"
