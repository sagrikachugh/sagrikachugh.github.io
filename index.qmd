Hey there! Welcome to my corner of computational biology. Join me on this wild ride as I navigate the tangled web of single-cell genomics, armed with nothing but code and a few cups of coffee.

I am a computational biology PhD student in the [Bioinformatics and Cellular Genomics Lab](https://www.svi.edu.au/laboratories/bioinformatics-cellular-genomics/) at [St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research](https://www.svi.edu.au/) and University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.\
\
My research focuses on single-cell genomics data analysis and development of computational tools for a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases.

Outside of work, I love to travel on a budget and catch up on my beauty sleep.
