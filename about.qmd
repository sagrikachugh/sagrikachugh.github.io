## My journey

I started off in the wet lab, splashing around with pipettes and microscopes but soon realized my true calling involved less splashing and more coding. Now, as a final-year PhD student at the University of Melbourne, I'm knee-deep in single-cell genomics data, crafting cool computational tools to help biologists interpret their data better. Think of me as a data detective with a caffeine habit.

Outside of research, I enjoy budget travel and ensuring I get enough rest to stay refreshed and inspired. Join me in exploring the fascinating intersections of biology and data scienceâ€”there's always something new to discover!
