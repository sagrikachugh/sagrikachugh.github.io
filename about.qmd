## My journey

I started off in the wet lab, splashing around with pipettes and microscopes but soon realized my true calling involved less splashing and more coding. As a PhD student, I delved in single-cell genomics data, crafting cool computational tools to help biologists interpret their data better. Think of me as a data detective with a caffeine habit.

My academic path started with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biotechnology, where I designed solutions to combat indoor air pollution. This early work honed my skills in experimental design and problem-solving. Following this, I shifted my focus to studying *Plasmodium falciparum*, the malaria-causing parasite, delving into its complex biology. My interest in data analysis blossomed during this period, leading me to pursue a Master's degree in Bioinformatics, where I deepened my expertise in computational methods for biological data.
